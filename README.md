# Rolling-Dice

The goal of the project is to create a simple command-line dice rolling game. The game allows the user to roll a virtual dice and displays the result as a graphical representation of the dice face. The user is prompted to roll again or exit the game after each roll. This project may serve as a simple exercise for practicing basic programming concepts such as random number generation, conditional statements, and user input/output.

## Instructions to run the game

* Clone the repository to your local machine using the command: git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
Replace username with the username of the repository owner and repository-name with the name of the repository.

* Navigate to the cloned repository's directory using the command: cd repository-name
Replace repository-name with the name of the cloned repository.

* Open the file dice_game.py using any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

* Run the code 
 
* Follow the instructions displayed in the console to play the game.

## Functionality of the code


The code is a simple dice rolling game that uses the random module to generate a random number between 1 and 6 (inclusive) for each roll of the dice. Depending on the result of the roll, the program prints an ASCII art representation of the corresponding side of a dice.

The code also includes a loop that allows the user to roll the dice again by typing "yes" when prompted. If the user types "no", the loop terminates and the program ends.
